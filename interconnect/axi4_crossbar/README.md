# axi4_crossbar Verification Handoff

## 📝 Overview
This directory contains the Verilog source, testbench, and verification instructions for the `axi4_crossbar` module.

The `axi4_crossbar` module implements a high-performance 15-master by 9-slave AXI4 crossbar interconnect utilizing flattened array ports for true parameterization. It features internal address decoding to route transactions to appropriate memory-mapped slave regions (e.g., L2 Cache, DDR4, peripherals) and employs a Weighted Round-Robin (WRR) arbitration scheme to manage concurrent access requests from multiple masters to a shared slave. The module effectively demultiplexes master requests and multiplexes slave responses, resolving multi-master contentions per slave dynamically.

## 🎯 What to Test
The verification engineer should ensure that:
1. The module resets correctly and all internal states initialize to safe values.
2. All interface protocols (e.g., AXI4, APB, native valid/ready) are strictly adhered to.
3. Edge cases specific to this IP (e.g., full/empty flags for FIFOs, cache misses for memory, etc.) are manually exercised.

## ▶️ Simulation Instructions
1. **Compile**: `iverilog -o sim.vvp axi4_crossbar.v tb_axi4_crossbar.v` (Include dependencies using ` -I ../../includes -I` if necessary)
2. **Simulate**: `vvp sim.vvp`
3. **View**: `gtkwave tb_axi4_crossbar.vcd`

## 💉 Injected Stimulus Profile
An advanced Python DV script has automatically generated a fully functional SystemVerilog testbench for this module. The following aggressive stimulus is applied during simulation:

### Clocks Auto-Toggled:
- `clk` toggling every 3.6ns (138.8 MHz)

### Reset Sequence:
- `rst_n` driven to 0 then 1 over 100ns.

### Data Buses Randomized:
Over 500 consecutive cycles, the following inputs receive constrained `$random` logic values to aggressively exercise datapaths and control flow:
- `m_awvalid`
- `m_awaddr`
- `m_awid`
- `m_wvalid`
- `m_wdata`
- `m_wstrb`
- `m_wlast`

### 📝 Results and Observations
- **Input Stimulation:** `clk` toggles continuously at 138.8 MHz, and `rst_n` properly asserts low and releases to high at 100ns. All flattened AXI4 master inputs (e.g., `m_awvalid`, `m_awaddr`, `m_wvalid`) and slave inputs (e.g., `s_awready`, `s_rvalid`) are driven with highly dense, randomized toggling.
- **Output Validation:** Despite the aggressive input stimulation, all master outputs (e.g., `m_awready`, `m_wready`) and slave outputs (e.g., `s_awvalid`, `s_awaddr`, `s_wvalid`) remain completely flat at logic 0 or logic 1 (inactive). The crossbar is failing to route any transactions from the masters to the slaves. This typically happens when the testbench relies on purely randomized $random stimuli for a complex protocol like AXI4, which requires a specific coordinated sequence of valid/ready handshakes and valid address ranges to pass through the crossbar's internal address decoders.
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ **INCONCLUSIVE**. The module simulates without crashing, but the purely randomized testbench fails to stimulate any valid routed traffic through the crossbar. A protocol-aware directed test is necessary to verify the routing logic.
