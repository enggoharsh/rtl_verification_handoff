# plic Verification Handoff

## 📝 Overview
This directory contains the Verilog source, testbench, and verification instructions for the `plic` module.

The plic (Platform-Level Interrupt Controller) module manages global asynchronous external interrupts across the SoC and routes them to multiple hart targets (e.g., machine and supervisor modes). It features a priority encoder that evaluates pending interrupts from up to 186 sources against per-target thresholds and enables. The configuration and interrupt claim/complete processes are managed via a memory-mapped APB slave interface.

## 🎯 What to Test
The verification engineer should ensure that:
1. The module resets correctly and all internal states initialize to safe values.
2. All interface protocols (e.g., AXI4, APB, native valid/ready) are strictly adhered to.
3. Edge cases specific to this IP (e.g., full/empty flags for FIFOs, cache misses for memory, etc.) are manually exercised.

## 🔍 GTKWave Signals to Observe
Add the following key signals to your GTKWave trace for structural inspection:
### Inputs
- `uut.clk`: The system clock driving the APB interface and pending interrupt registers.
- `uut.rst_n`: The active-low reset signal initializing all priorities, enables, and thresholds.
- `uut.interrupt_sources`: The bit-vector of raw external interrupt requests from the platform.
- `uut.psel`: The APB select signal for configuring the PLIC registers.
- `uut.penable`: The APB enable signal for the bus transfer phase.
- `uut.pwrite`: The APB control signal specifying a read or write operation.
- `uut.paddr`: The APB 24-bit address bus addressing the PLIC memory map.
- `uut.pwdata`: The APB 32-bit write data bus for setting configurations and claiming interrupts.

### Outputs
- `uut.prdata`: The APB 32-bit read data bus for retrieving configurations and identifying the highest priority pending interrupt.
- `uut.pready`: The APB ready signal, always asserted for zero-wait access.
- `uut.irq_targets`: The per-target (hart/privilege mode) external interrupt notification flags.

## ▶️ Simulation Instructions
1. **Compile**: `iverilog -o sim.vvp plic.v tb_plic.v` (Include dependencies using ` -I ../../includes -I` if necessary)
2. **Simulate**: `vvp sim.vvp`
3. **View**: `gtkwave tb_plic.vcd`

## 💉 Injected Stimulus Profile
An advanced Python DV script has automatically generated a fully functional SystemVerilog testbench for this module. The following aggressive stimulus is applied during simulation:

### Clocks Auto-Toggled:
- `clk` toggling every 3.6ns (138.8 MHz)

### Reset Sequence:
- `rst_n` driven to 0 then 1 over 100ns.

### Data Buses Randomized:
Over 500 consecutive cycles, the following inputs receive constrained `$random` logic values to aggressively exercise datapaths and control flow:
- `interrupt_sources`
- `psel`
- `penable`
- `pwrite`
- `paddr`
- `pwdata`
